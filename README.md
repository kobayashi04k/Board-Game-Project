# Board-Game-Project
A combination of a the popular board game Sorry and RPG turn-based combat.

A Java game where each player controls four pieces. The objective of the game is for one player to circle around the board and reach home - similar to Sorry. The main difference, however, is whenever too opposing pieces land on the same spot, they will engage in a turn-based combat game. The winner of the match stays on the spot, and the loser is sent back to the start.
